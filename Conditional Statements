//Conditional Statements and Loops
/*
Types
while(condition) repeats loop until condition is false

for(var; condition; var++) repeats loop until condition is false
  basically a shorthand while loop

if(condition) enters loop if condition true, exits after reaching last line
  generally the most useful, since you can do other stuff for different conditions

else if(condition) enters loop if above if condition and all above else if conditions are false
  must be used in conjunction with an if statement

else enters loop if the if condition and all related else if conditions are false

/*Examples (still won't compile, there's no task main)
while(true) { 
//code goes here
} //this loop never ends, it's one of the most common conditions for our purposes

for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
//do something
} //i is allowed to be used at any time inside the for loop
//use a for loop for anything that has a known number of iterations, like assigning a value to members of an array

for(i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  foo[i] = val;
} //all members have the same value in this, but you can use an operator to fix that
for(i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  foo[i] = val * i;
}  //Now the value of a given member of array foo is the value of (i * val), which changes for each member
*/

//This will compile, it's an example of a for loop and an if-else if-else block

int foo[5]; //Declares an array with 5 int members
const int k = 25; //const prefix makes a variable a constant, so it cannot be changed
int val = 0;

task main() {
  for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    foo[i] = k * i;
    printf("Member #%f: %f\n" i+1, foo[i]); //show the member of the array, and its value
//we will go over this function later, but it basically displays a string on the screen
  }
  
  for(int a; a < 10; a++) {
    if(val > 25) {
      printf("25\n");
    }
    else if(val < 5) {
      printf("5\n");
    }
    
    else {
      printf("25 > x > 5");
    }
  }
}
